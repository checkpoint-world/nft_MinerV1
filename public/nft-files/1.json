  "description": "In 2011, it was a very nice meeting during the G20 in Cannes where a huge businessman from Singapore, Mr. Leong, guest donor, asked me to make a panda sculpture for his attachment to art and the animal in Endangered. The next day, I send him my preparatory sketches instantly and it was the start of a huge adventure in China, Singapore and everywhere in Asia. ",
